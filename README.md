# ND-Popular-Movies-App
Source code for the popular movies application developed as a project in the Udacity Android Nanodegree course.

The project involves building an application to help users discover popular and recent movies. The application has a clean UI, syncs to a server, and presents information to the user. The application also provides a detail view for each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies, and also has tablet layouts to support tablets. The data for favourite movies is persisted using a database and the application uses a content provider on top of the database to provide information to the user.

The project uses default directory structure used in Android Studio and Gradle. To view the project, clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio.
